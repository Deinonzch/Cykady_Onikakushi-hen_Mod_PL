"\"...Herm?"

" Those guys just now...\""

"They had National Diet badges.\""

"\"Then it's prefectural assembly member and city councilor Sonozaki.\""

"\"That's interesting."

" The prefectural assembly member and city councilor are related.\""

"\"It's dirty is what it is."

" Shouting out each other's name during elections."

" While one is up for election, the other one holds an assembly, and they double up their campaign activities."

" Blatantly.\""

"\"I don't know much about this stuff, but isn't that against the rules of the election?\""

"\"As long as they have no prior consultation, there are no restrictions on their political activities."

" Kuma-chan, the investigation division is going to be pretty tough for you."

" You should at least brush up on election policies.\""

"\"I'm not suited for the intelligence division."

" 'Cause I'm dumb. Heheheh...!\""

"There was prefectural assembly member Sonozaki and city councilor Sonozaki."

"Also... the Mayor of Hinamizawa."

"...All of them involved with the Sonozaki family."

" What crap..."

"\"Looks like they were seen off by... the department chief and the deputy chief.\""

"It came to me."

"That night, when the chief invited me along to get some oden, I thought that was it."

"\"You have a lot of connections, so you might have heard something..."

" Did you?\""

"\"Nope."

" Not a thing.\""

"\"Ma'am, I'll take a tofu fritter and fish cake."

" A councilor barked at me in the police chief's stead.\""

"\"Oh, my. Is that so?"

" Ma'am, I'll take another bowl.\""

"Prefectural assembly member Sonozaki and city councilor Sonozaki were both intimidating."

"Our snot-nosed career police chief couldn't even handle being yelled at by them. They're like yakuza..."

"\"A petition with your name came up regarding how the investigation of the Hinamizawa incident is being handled.\""

"\"Goodness, me?"

" I've not the faintest.\""

"\"No need to play dumb."

" You're reopening the past cases regarding Hinamizawa,"

" aren't you?\""

"\"I've already got my hands full with Tomitake's death, actually."

" Nahahaha!\""

"\"Really?"

" If that's true, then there's no problem...\""

"There was a period of silence."

"While we were silent, we made headway on our food and drink."

"\"Whew, that was quite the feast."

" This month has been a bunch of losses for me, so my wallet was feeling the pinch."

" Much appreciated.\""

"\"Nah, it's nothing."

" Tell me a good horse again."

" I'll bet on the same one as you.\""

"\"Nahahahah!"

" I haven't been doing well there lately."

" I haven't been able to read the horses at all!"

" ...Taxi!!!\""

"I'm going by train."

"The police chief is taking a taxi."

"I have my own car, but it'd be rash to drive it home."

" Can't blow it right before retirement with a DUI."

"Even though he could still rattle off, it looked like his legs were already goo."

"Pushing him into the cab, I gave the driver the police chief's address."

"\"Well, see you again tomorrow."

" Happy New Year...!\""

"\"Ooishi-san.\""

"\"Yeah, yeah.\""

"\"The past incidents have all been closed."

" Stop lumping them all together."

" Those villagers half-believe it's really a curse.\""

"\"Well, I'm not convinced.\""

"\"You're going to be retiring next year, aren't you?"

"Weren't you going to pay off your mortgage with your pension and move up to Hokkaido with your mom?\""

"\"Mother pines to return to the land of her birth..."

" It's the least I can do."

" And the pension, well, it'll let me enjoy myself in Susukino."

" Nahahahah!!\""

"\"The police chief may issue a special retirement salary raise, he says.\""

"A public servant's pension is calculated based on their monthly salary."

"So if you were to get a raise right before retirement, your bonus (two years' salary) would be inflated,"

" and you'd get a heavy surplus of funds. That tends to be how it's done around here."

"Of course, it's not a custom that's thought of highly..."

"The difference between the bonus and the pension is quite a bit."

"\"I'd expect nothing less exemplary from our egg-head chief."

" But... well..."

" They say our salary is compensation for our hard work, but in the end it really just has to do with the passage of time.\""

"That's not something I can laugh at, but I'll laugh through it, anyway."

"\"I don't think it's anything exemplary."

" But given how hard you've worked, it's not odd that you're getting that much of a pension."

" I'd like to get that much myself.\""

"\"If I can get it, well, of course I'd want it."

" Nahahahah!\""

"\"You'll get it."

" You're an adult, after all.\""

"\"Sorry for holding you up here, Driver."

" Thank you very much.\""

"I closed the door roughly, interrupting the chief's conversation a bit rudely."

"It looked like the chief still had something to say, but he just smiled wryly and waved. I waved in return."

"The cab sped up gradually, and soon disappeared among the sea of lights."

"\"Nahahahah!"

" ...Oh, man..."

" I wonder if I really can repay that loan...\""
